My Gpui Shell.

A WIP wayland desktop shells building from scratch.

The rendering part is based on my fork of [gpui](https://github.com/wuliuqii/zed/) which I added some wayland features like `Layer Shell` to create wayland desktop shells.

And that's for learning purpose. Currently, I'm trying to implement a status bar and a launcher.

## FEATURES

- [ ] status bar
- [ ] launcher
- [ ] maybe more

## SCREENSHOTS
